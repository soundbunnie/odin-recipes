    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>French Bread Pizza was invented in the early 1800s by the late King Tut, who was the first to discover tomatoes. Bread, too. Pretty impressive guy.</p>
    <p>After the war, Tut was able to finally popularize the recipe of his dreams (that his slaves created for him) and after a few iterations, we arrive at the modern
        version of French Bread Pizza, pioneered by Kenji Lopez Alt.

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, finely minced</li>
        <li>Pinch red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon oregano</li>
        <li>1/4 cup minced fresh parsley</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 large loaf French bread</li>
        <li>1 can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>8 ounces freshly grated mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>2 ounces grated parmesano-reggiano</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Adjust oven rack to upper position and preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Heat butter and 3 tablespoons (45ml) olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat until butter is melted. Add garlic, pepper flakes, and oregano and cook, stirring occasionally, until garlic is softened but not browned, about 2 minutes. Stir in half of parsley/basil and a big pinch of salt. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Place bread cut-side-up on a clean work surface. Using a rimmed baking sheet, press down on bread evenly until compressed to about 2/3rds of its original height. Place bread on top of rimmed baking sheet. Using a pastry brush, brush half of garlic/butter/oil mixture evenly over cut surfaces of bread, making sure to get plenty of bits of garlic and herbs. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Add tomatoes to remaining garlic/butter/oil mixture in pan, stir to combine, increase heat to medium, bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to maintain a bare simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until rich and reduced, about 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt.</li>
        <li>While sauce cooks, spread 1/4 of mozzarella evenly over surface of bread and transfer to oven. Cook until cheese is barely melted, about 8 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside until sauce is cooked.</li>
    </ol>
