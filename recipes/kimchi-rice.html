    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>It all started one fateful night in December of 1988.</p>
    <p>The harsh winds of a cruel winter pelted my face with snow. I know I was with my family. I know they were trying to say something to me -- but they just couldn't.
        Their voices were not loud enough to pierce through the wind.
    </p>
    <p>They say that snow makes everything seem quiet. Peaceful. I disagree. To me, there is nothing louder than the sound of silence, which brings me to my next point.
    </p>
    <p>
        Kimchi fried rice. It's uh, exactly what it sounds like.
